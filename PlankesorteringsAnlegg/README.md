======

This software, the "Educational simulator for control-system development" is written as part of a programming-project 
in the course DAT220 at the University of Agder (UiA), Norway.

The aim of the project is to create simulation-environments that can be used in educating students in control-
system development.


###The project contains 3 main logical components:

*	A simulator 
*	A communicator
*	An "Arduino Mega 2560"-based API


####Simulator

For the time being the simulator contains only one SimulatorPage. This SimulatorPage contains a
simulated PlankSortingPlant.

The simulator component is built on top of Erin Cattos Box2D 2.2.1.


####Communicator

The communicator is a class that is able to read and write simulated sensor and actuator data over a serial-
port.

The communicator component is built on top of the Boost.Asio-library.


####API

The simulator-API lets students write control-systems for simulated environments.

Tha API is based on Paul Bj√∏rn Andersens(UiA) RTOS-kernel, TSS, and his usart-library.
